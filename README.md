The ptocedure followed was:
- Importing and reading the files for analysis.
- Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) was done to determine the data structures involved.
- Data cleaning was done to ensure that data being analysed was in the intended type and style.
- Analysis of the data.
- Data visualization to present the analysed data.
